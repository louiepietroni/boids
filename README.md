# Boids
This is a simulation of boids, as described [on this website](http://red3d.com/cwr/boids/). These are simple agents which combine 3 behaviours to interact with their flock mates.  

This project has been heavily inspired by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) and [Daniel Shiffman of The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain).  

To use this project, you need to start a local server. It is very easy to do this by opening the project in vscode, then using the [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension, then clicking go live!
